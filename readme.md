> Combining a [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)

This compiles to a ~ 4 MB binary while being faster than electron-based Todoist these days. Note, this is a fun project. There is no persistence or any feature implemented.

You can find the source code in the examples folder, react. Also a binary is available in releases.
